# Quality Assurance

### Feed Quality
Methods for assuring and testing feed quality will be part of the discussions in the farming method consulting sessions with Jakub Dzamba, the designer of our farming system.

### Product Quality
Methods for assuring and testing feed quality will also be part of consulting sessions with Dzamba.

FDA compliant nutrition testing and labeling will be done for all products.

### Tracability/Recalls
All units (bags of insects) sold will be numbered, and records will be kept of which rearing bin(s) were used to fill each unit. With the exception of small farmer's market sales, records of the purchaser of each unit will be kept. Should any bin be suspect of having been sub-standard, dangerous, or otherwise unacceptable, all corresponding serial numbers will immediately be recalled and appropriate refunds will be issued.
