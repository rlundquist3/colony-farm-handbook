# Colony Farm
## Business Plan

Revised August 25, 2016

### 1. Executive Summary

Colony Farm is an insect farm and food processor. The company, founded by Henry Pointon and Riley Lundquist, both graduates of Kalamazoo College, is starting in Bend, Oregon. The company intends to raise insects and produce related products while spreading knowledge about insects as a more environmentally responsible alternative to other animal protein. The company is interested in developing efficient methods of raising insects and in environmentally responsible agriculture as a whole.

The founders have raised insects on a small scale since the fall of 2015, completed a self-designed college course on entomophagy and insect farming, and attended Eating Insects Detroit, the first international entomophagy conference.

#### 1.1. Mission & Vision
* Colony Farm's mission is to spread and diversify entomophagy for the benefit of society and the environment.
* Colony Farm's vision is to inspire and contribute to a more stable and diverse food system.

#### 1.2. Principles
In pursuing this mission, Colony Farm intends to use the following principles to guide its decisions:

* work for the environment
* work for communities at all levels
* work for the individual
* work for the future

#### 1.3. Objectives
* develop the most environmentally and socially responsible methods of raising insects
* make products that are approachable, attractive, and delicious both for customers accustomed to eating insects and those who are a bit more apprehensive

#### 1.4. Keys to Success
* In order to develop the most responsible methods of insect production, Colony Farm hopes to build relationships and partnerships with researchers and others in the industry. Sharing ideas and techniques will lead to more efficient and less damaging production on a larger level. From the outset, the company will work closely with Jakub Dzamba, an architect and insect farmer, to design the best systems possible.
* Publishing recipes, sharing ideas, working with local chefs and bakers, and talking with customers about what they would like to see will help make insect consumption more attractive.
* Educating the community—especially children and young adults—about why eating insects can be beneficial to both the consumer and the environment and how it can be delicious, will make Colony Farm’s products more approachable.

-------------------

### 3. Products
Insects, which are regularly eaten in many areas of the world, are a nutritional source relatively unrecognized in North America and much of Europe. Colony Farm believes that insects have the potential to replace some of the protein currently sourced from beef, pork, poultry, and seafood.

The company intends to sell insects whole as well as in various processed forms to end-consumers as well as other processors, restaurants, etc. Crickets will be the first product offered, with a plan to soon venture into production of other insects.

--------------------

### 4. Market Analysis
While still a very new market in North America, entomophagy has grown quickly in the past few years.

#### 4.1. Growth
* between 2012 and 2016, the number of insect farms in North America has grown from 1 to around 13
* between 2012 and 2016, the number of North American companies producing food with insects as ingredients has risen from 2 to more than 40
* restaurants seem to have found similar growth, although this data is less known

#### 4.2. Colony Farm's Advantage
All of the other farms growing insects for human consumption in North America are raising crickets and/or mealworms and are not showing any indication of changing focus. With the entomophagy industry growing as it is, consumers will begin to want to try other insects.

Colony Farm plans to begin by growing crickets, but soon start raising other insects, such as grasshoppers, as well. Raising crickets will allow the farm to get to market and be better positioned to introduce customers to other insects.

-------------

### 5. Strategy
Colony Farm is dedicated to environmental responsibility. The company intends to provide more access to insect protein while being as responsible as possible. In this way, Colony Farm hopes to become an example of efficient, responsible, and resilient production, inspiring others in the industry and similar ones to reduce impacts and find solutions to environmental issues.

#### 5.1. Marketing Strategy
Colony Farm will initially market its products to local consumers wherever it first establishes business. The company would soon thereafter like to expand online sales. A significant portion of crickets will be sold to outside processors.

Marketing its products as better than the competition and directly attacking other products or alternatives is not an interest of Colony Farm. Part of the strategy will indeed be informing customers of comparative environmental and social impacts, but informing customers of the positive aspects of the company’s products is more desirable than demonizing the competition.

It is the hope that working responsibly and informing customers about the strengths of Colony Farm’s products will be more effective than spending all resources on magazine, television, or internet advertisement.

#### 5.2. Social & Environmental Responsibility
As a socially and environmentally responsible business, Colony Farm intends to constantly work toward making improvements on its production and reducing impact. At this point in development, there is not much to improve upon, but the company plans to research the least impactful solutions practical to future problems it encounters.

Since the mission of Colony Farm is not simply to sell insects, rather to work toward reducing environmental impacts of agriculture, the company intends to spread its knowledge and standards to other interested parties. If insect protein is to eventually replace any significant portion of that sourced from other livestock, many more farms will need to begin along a similar path. Colony Farm is very willing to become involved in teaching others and helping them get started.

The company realizes that eating insects is something about which many in North America may be apprehensive. For this reason, it hopes to spend much of its time informing children, students, athletes, and other groups about its mission, working toward getting them more willing to eat insects in various forms.

### 6. Finances

#### 6.1. Calculations
__cricket production:__

estimated production of 3900 pounds per month

current wholesale price is about $4/lb

$$3900 lbs/mo * $4/lb = $15,600/mo$$

1298 sqft farming area

$$$15,6000/mo / 1298 sqft = $12/sqft/mo$$

__cricket frass production:__

~.5 lbs frass/lb crickets

$$.5 * 3900 lbs/mo * $1.50/lb = $2925$$ (potential)

#### 6.2. Startup Projections
The following are year one projections of best-case (with loan) and worst-case (without loan) scenarios. The loan that has been applied for would allow us to be at full production within 2 months. Without a loan, we would be able to reach this production within 6-8 months after earning sufficient funds to pay for larger production space. The worst-case projection does not take this scale-up into account (i.e. revenue would likely be higher).
